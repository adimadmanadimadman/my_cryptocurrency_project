USE OF PROJECT
  This site serves as a cryptocurrency trading platform. It utilizes the WazirX API (https://api.wazirx.com/api/v2/tickers) to fetch details of cryptocurrency tickers. The server is called both on page load and when the cryptocurrency selection changes. In the backend, data corresponding to the selected ticker is fetched, stored, and then retrieved from the database to be displayed on the user interface. The data is refreshed every 60 seconds to ensure it remains up-to-date.
